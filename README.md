## FAQ

#### Who can apply?

We’re looking for Senior Backend Engineers who have relevant experience either in the commerce domain, in building resilient and high performance APIs or are experts in one of the technologies we use (e.g. ElasticSearch or MongoDB). JVM experience is also a bonus.

You must be motivated to learn Scala and functional programming.

#### I won’t have to ship any code in the first month?

Yes. We like to take a long-term view: Our Senior Backend Engineers typically stay for several years. You’ll ship a lot of great code later!

#### I learn best by shipping code - do I have to be stuck learning theory for a month?

No, the onboarding plan is tailored together with you. Let us know what works best for you!

#### I’ve used Scala in pet projects and have done the coursera courses you mentioned. Do I have to do them again?

No, the onboarding plan is tailored together with you. We’ll select more advanced material with you, and you’ll probably start working on our code base sooner.

#### What will you check in the interviews?

You should show you’ve mastered your current programming language. We’ll also talk about other tech you’ve used (e.g. databases), architecture and building software. No whiteboard coding, promised :)

#### Will I receive a junior salary while I’m onboarded to Scala?

No, your salary will be based on your overall experience as a Senior Backend Engineer. However we expect that you invest your education budget into learning Scala. After you are proficient in Scala, you are free to spend it on books, conferences etc. as you see fit.

#### Is working remotely possible if I’m learning Scala?

Yes!

#### At the end of my probation period, what Scala skills am I expected to have?

We understand that after 6 months, you won’t have mastered every aspect of Scala or functional programming (who has, anyway?). However, we expect you to have reached an intermediary Scala level and that you are able to contribute regular features to our code base.
